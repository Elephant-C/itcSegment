This is a tutorial on how to use the library ictSegment.

First the package should be loaded:

```{r}
library(itcSegment)
```

Afterwards some data needs to be available:

```{r}
data(lasData)
summary(lasData)
```

As underlined in the data documentation the loaded data coordinates are in the coordinates system UTM WGS84 32N (EPSG code 32632).

```{r}
se<-itcLiDAR(lasData$X,lasData$Y,lasData$Z,epsg=32632)
```

We can visualize the result changing the color of the ITC according to its height:

```{r}
colors<-terrain.colors(20)[as.numeric(cut(se$Height_m,breaks = 20))]
plot(se,axes=T,col=colors)
```

A summary of the delineated ITCs can be seen with:

```{r}
summary(se)
```

To save the data use rgdal function called writeOGR using the driver "ESRI SHapefile". For more help see rgdal package.
